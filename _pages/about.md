# About

Hi! My name is Pan Chen. I'm a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Colorado-Boulder. My primary research interests include environmental economics and development, with secondary interests in economic history, technical change, and political economy. My curent work examines how childhood exposure to policy shocks impacts later-life outcomes. **I'm on the economics job market for the 2025-2026 cycle.**

Before enrolling in the PhD program, I worked as an economic analyst at WISDRI, an engineering company in China specializing in the design and construction of steel plants.
