# About

Hi! My name is Pan Chen. I'm a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Colorado, Boulder. My primary research interests lie in environment, development, and economic history, with secondary interests in political economy. Currently, my work examines how childhood exposure to energy policy shocks impacts later-life outcomes. 

Before enrolling in the PhD program, I worked as an economic analyst at WISDRI, an engineering company in China specializing in the design and construction of steel plants, from 2018 to 2021.

I enjoy playing basketball and can be found on the court every Friday night throughout the semester.
