# About

Hi! I'm Pan Chen, a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Colorado, Boulder. My primary research interests lie in environment, development, and economic history, with secondary interests in political economy. Currently, my work examines how childhood exposure to policy shocks impacts later-life outcomes.
I enjoy playing basketball (though I'm not the best)--just for fun--and you'll find me on the court every Friday night at the CU Boulder Rec Center during the semester.
