# About

Hi! My name is Pan Chen. I'm a 5th PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Colorado-Boulder. My primary research interests include development economics and environmental economics, with secondary interests in economic history, technical change, and political economy. My curent work examines how childhood exposure to policy shocks impacts later-life outcomes. **I'm on the economics job market for the 2025-2026 cycle.**
